# BigTreeTech Filament Motion Sensor 2020 mount

Part removed from thingiverse due to their anti-adblocker system requiring me to turn off all of Firefox's tracking protection. This is intrusive and I don't like it. I don't run an adblocker, but I like my privacy. Part is available at https://github.com/strayr/small-fff-projects/tree/main/BTT_FMS

## Description

I modified https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4151810 so my direct drive extruder doesn't smack into it when mounted on the top rail.
