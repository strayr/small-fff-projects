# Ender 3 v2 Hydra Mount

Part removed from thingiverse due to their anti-adblocker system requiring me to turn off all of Firefox's tracking protection. This is intrusive and I don't like it. I don't run an adblocker, but I like my privacy. Part is available at http://github.com/strayr/small-fff-projects/E3V2_hydra

Added an extra tab tab to cut down on some of the rocking moments that an DD extruder can introduce. It's just a bit more rigidly mounted to the X carriage. Has been working really well for me for months, although I think my initial problems that caused me to design this may have been a partial blockage. Either way my setup is really stiff, which makes for really accurate pressure control, which gives really tidy corners and seams on fast prints.
