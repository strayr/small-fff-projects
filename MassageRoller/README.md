# Massage Roller

This started when I was asked for a broom handle to stand on to stretch the requester's foot. I only had thin hollow tube broom handles that were not up to the task so I thought about printing something. I distinctly remember using a dryer ball (like a hard spiky tennis ball) after a motorcycle injury and I thought i could make something that would work better.

The small roller is fairly gentle and accomplished the original task as required. The big roller is a bit more evil. It's intense. It feels great.

Print vertically for best chance of success. No supports required. I'm using 4 perimiters, 20% infill adaptive cubic, it seems to be enough.
