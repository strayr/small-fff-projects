# Bios: Genesis Insert

Part removed from thingiverse due to their anti-adblocker system requiring me to turn off all of Firefox's tracking protection. This is intrusive and I don't like it. I don't run an adblocker, but I like my privacy. Part is available at https://github.com/strayr/small-fff-projects/tree/main/bios_genesis_insert

## Description

I thought the original honeycomb grid lids were a bit flimsy at 0.5mm so I beefed them up to 1mm. I also found a prusaslicer bug where one edge of the lid top was coming out one layer thick or not printing so I made a quickfix.Either way my lids are a little more durable. Boxes are unchanged.

MysteryDough's original boxes are unchanged and I really appreciate the effort made in sharing these.

I've reported the bug on the prusaslicer github, and the original/stretched parts print with cura and superslicer, but cura won't run on my laptop and superslicer is too much like living on the edge for me. YMMV
