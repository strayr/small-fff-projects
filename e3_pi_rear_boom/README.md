# Ender 3 2020 rear view pi camera mount

Part removed from thingiverse due to their anti-adblocker system requiring me to turn off all of Firefox's tracking protection. This is intrusive and I don't like it. I don't run an adblocker, but I like my privacy. Part is available at https://github.com/strayr/small-fff-projects/tree/main/e3_pi_rear_boom

## Description

Rear mounted Rasberry Pi camera for ender 3 and anything else that uses a 2020 x gantry. Distance from the gantry is adjustable with a slide mechanism.

Remixes https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3417079 and I have re-uploaded the pin and camera body unchanged. I've grafted the end of the boom onto the movable slide. It's really quick and dirty but it works really well.

Needs an m3x6mm bolt and a matching nut.

Additional inspiration from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2761965, mostly through version one of this being a broken boom zip tied into this and getting a better view of the nozzle from the rear than the front.
