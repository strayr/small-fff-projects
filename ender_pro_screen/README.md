# Ender 3 screen enclosure

A screen enclosure for an ender 3 (pro). Overly chunky mount.

## Description

This was one of the first things I made for my ender 3 v2, after getting a pro screen off ebay as software support for the v2 screen was very bad. It's currently in use on my [switchwire conversion](https://youtu.be/1jdEZjXb070).

To print the coloured logo version, open the STL with PrusaSlicer or SuperSlicer, orient it on the bed and split into parts. Hide the case parts leaving the logo and stripes, print those in you highlight colour then hide those parts and unhide the case and print in your main colour. Make sure to set a z-hop high enough to miss the logo parts and that z-hop is permitted on your first layer.
