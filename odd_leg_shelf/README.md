# Odd Leg Shelf

This is something I made to put plant pots on my windowsills. They have a UPVC molding that is 7mm high that protrudes quite far, and the frames are quite thick, so this lifts my small plants up into the sun and maximises the windowsill space available.

You need some 80mm wide board. This was an accidental size, I have offcuts after getting shelves made for my print room. I painted them white. I have had one of these in my bedroom window for about 6 months and not killed my spider plants yet and have just started printing another for my office.
